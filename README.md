The Post-Blog project is a blogging platform built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates). It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts. The project follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, with routes handling requests, models managing the database, and templates rendering the UI. The app also includes middlewares, authentication, and database configurations. It's a simple yet functional blogging system for managing and displaying posts dynamically. ðŸš€
